# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
Starting to work on the FreeCodeCamp Tutorials.

**Thoughts:**
Should be fun.

### Day 2: January 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
* Completed introduction tutorials to HTML and CSS (in line styling, CSS styling, nesting elements, element id's, div's, forms, checkboxes, radio buttons, margins, padding, class declaration overriding, and more).
* Begun working on responsive web design using Bootstrap

**Thoughts**:
The tutorials were pretty straightforward and intuitive, so I did not encounter any major hurdles.
Today was the last day of Winter Break, which means that second semester of senior year begins tomorrow. Hopefully, the workload does not prevent me from continuing to learn web development and put in my committed 1 hour/day.

### Day 3: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
* Completed Bootstrap tutorials

**Thoughts**:
Not as much time today, unfortunately. Will put in more work tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
* Completed the rest of the introductory JQuery Tutorials
* Made a lot of progress starting on the Alan Turing Tribute webpage project: http://codepen.io/kha/pen/egJKmJ?editors=1100

**Thoughts**:
Happy with the progress I was able to make today on finishing up the introductory FreeCodeCamp tutorials as well as diving into the front end projects. I really am enjoying the design aspect of web development, as I did with iOS development. Hoping to eventually get experienced with JQuery and cool interactive front end web development (maybe for my personal site?).

### Day 5: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
* Added an image slideshow, timeline, quotes, and quick navigation buttons to my Alan Turing tribute webpage
* Completed 'Tribute Page' project on FreeCodeCamp: http://codepen.io/kha/pen/egJKmJ

**Thoughts**: Had fun creating my first webpage from scratch and implementing features such as the slideshow (using help from W3) and the navigation menu buttons. Made up coding time for skipping yesterday and will begin on the personal webpage (portfolio) tomorrow, hopefully.

### Day 6: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
* Worked on setting up the basic structure for my personal website / portfolio. Messed around with the "rotating text" library with a lot of bugs.

**Thoughts**: Good to finally get started on the project that made me want to get into web development in the first place. Will probably spend quite some time here because I want to fully personalize the site.

### Day 7: January 14, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
* Continued working on the individual sections of the website, focusing on the "intro" page and the "about me" page.

**Thoughts**: Running into a lot of issues in terms of creating a responsive website. Research and experimentation is a good learning experience though.
